             A TDM bus is one application of the principle of time-division
	     multiplexing.

	     In a TDM Bus, data or information arriving from an input line is
	     put onto specific timeslots on a high-speed bus, where a recipient
	     would listen to the bus and pick out only the signals for
	     a certain timeslot.

	     It resembles the TDM carried out in synchronous optical
	     networking, but the "TDM Bus" term is more commonly used when the
	     bus is inside a single unit like a telecommunications switch or a
	     PC.
